# Rice-Disease-Detection
The project tells us whether or not an image of a rice plant is healthy using image classification. Where I live, rice is a very important resource and a major part of our economy, so it is extremely important for us to be able to monitor the condition of the rice crops.

# The Algorithm
The algorithm was trained using the Jetson Nano using a retrained resnet18 model, the dataset consists of images of rice leaves classified under 'healthy', 'leafblight' and 'brownspot'
